# Coderisland

This is a monorepo that contains several javascript apps that I have created to implement and experiment on ideas.

## List of Apps

1. [CeeVee](https://ceevee.lhargil.com/) - Built with Angular and node.js, this app is used to manage one's resume and display it in a nice and beautiful way - on pause
2. [OmgImgFlow](https://omgimageflow.lhargil.com) - My [ImageFlow](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet-server) implementation using Angular and ASP.NET Core - *under active development*
3. EasyStreet - budgetting app - coming soon
4. [HomeCooked](https://homecooked.lhargil.com) - social network for the "chefs" at home. - *under active development*

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).
